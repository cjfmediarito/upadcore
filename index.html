	<h1>K.I.D.S.</h1>
	<p>
		One of the best things about being a JMAer is the K.I.D.S (Kids Integrated Development through Schooling) program. This program provides educational assistance for 40 less fortunate but brilliant children, in partnership with Tahanan ng Panginoon (Varsity Hills, Loyola Heights chapter). With 40 children already involved in the program, UP JMA remains committed in its social and moral obligation to help others in the community.
